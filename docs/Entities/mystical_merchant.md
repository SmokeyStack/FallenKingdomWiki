## Spawning

In the Overworld, mystical merchants can spawn on any solid block at a light level of 7 or less.

### Despawning

The mystical merchant will despawn once all the trades are locked and they are 24 blocks away from the player.

## Behaviour

The mystical merchant has 9 random trades. New trades are not unlocked after trading with it.

Mystical merchants avoid wandering traders and blocks of netherite.

Like villagers, mystical merchants can also close and open wooden doors.

## Drops

Mystical merchants do not drop anything

## Trading
 Mystical merchants only accept copper fragments with the last trade being an exclusion.
