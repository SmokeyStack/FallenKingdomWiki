The mystical merchant is a passive mob that randomly spawns near the player. It can trade.

## Spawning

In the Overworld, mystical merchants can spawn on any solid block at a light level of 7 or less.

### Despawning

The mystical merchant will despawn once all the trades are locked and they are 24 blocks away from the player.

## Behaviour

Mystical merchants avoid wandering traders and blocks of netherite.

Like villagers, mystical merchants can also close and open wooden doors.

## Trading
 Mystical merchants only accept copper fragments with the last trade being an exclusion.
